In this repository, you will find my master's thesis, and most of the Jupyter notebooks and files that constitute the code for its last chapter.
The recommended order for opening the notebooks is:
1. Datapreprocessing.ipynb
2. Featureselectionviaheatmap.ipynb 
3. PCA_UMAP.ipynb
4. STgraph.ipynb
5. Barcelonabarcodes.ipynb
The python files Aux_functions.py and pygraphsort.py are imported in some of these notebooks. The latter is owned by my thesis co-advisor James Nichols.

Regarding my algorithm problem-solving experience:

● I have competent theoretical knowledge of data structures and algorithms.

● I solved 57 LeetCode problems this year using Python, and lately I have been practicing daily.

● I solved 393 Codeforces problems using C++ between 2021 and 2022.
