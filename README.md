In this repository, you will find my master's thesis, and most of the Jupyter notebooks and files that constitute the code for its last chapter.
The recommended order for opening the notebooks is:
1. Datapreprocessing.ipynb
2. Featureselectionviaheatmap.ipynb 
3. PCA_UMAP.ipynb
4. STgraph.ipynb
5. Barcelonabarcodes.ipynb
