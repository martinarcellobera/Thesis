In this repository, you will find my Master's thesis, and most of the Jupyter notebooks and files that constitute the code for its last chapter. My supervisors have recommended that I submit my work to TopoInVis 2025.


The recommended order for opening the notebooks is:
1. Datapreprocessing.ipynb
2. Featureselectionviaheatmap.ipynb 
3. PCA_UMAP.ipynb
4. STgraph.ipynb
5. Barcelonabarcodes.ipynb
The Python files Aux_functions.py and pygraphsort.py are imported in some of these notebooks. The latter is owned by my thesis co-advisor James Nichols.

Regarding my algorithm problem-solving experience:

● I have competent theoretical knowledge of data structures and algorithms.

● I solved 57 LeetCode problems this year using Python, and lately I have been practicing daily.

● I solved 393 Codeforces problems using C++ between 2021 and 2022.
