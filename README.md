In this repository, you will find most of the Jupyter notebooks and files that constitute the code for the last chapter of my masterâ€™s thesis.
The recommended order for opening the notebooks is:
1. Datapreprocessing.ipynb
2. Featureselectionviaheatmap.ipynb 
3. PCA_UMAP.ipynb
4. STgraph.ipynb
5. Barcelonabarcodes.ipynb
